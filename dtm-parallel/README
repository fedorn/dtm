This directory contains an implementation of the dynamic influence
model intended to be run on a cluster of computers.  Compiling and
running this software has not been tested on other computers.  It is
therefore supported in no manner.

This implementation was designed with a PBS cluster in mind, with a
driver to be run on the head node.  If you are using a different
cluster, you can modify the cluster interface in c2_lib.c.
